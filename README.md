I employed Django to build the backend of the project, and enjoyed utilizing the inherent components of the framework to control the CRUD aspects of the application.
To seperate this from my previous project I added the model of LOCATION to enhance the sorting function of the application.
I tried getting the ForeignKey to display the locations name on the page but was unsuccessful. 
I plan to add a sorting function that allows the user to see all equipment based on a location or type.

I did not make it to adding a "Type" container like i had hoped, but plan to continue working on that this week. 
For now the user has to add equipment on the ski or snowboard page, where the type is already determined, to avoid any error in the form.
